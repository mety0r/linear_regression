Implementing a regression model to analyze the relationship between temperature and humidity in Bengaluru's weather.
Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It's commonly used for predicting outcomes and understanding the strength and direction of relationships between variables. The equation for a simple linear regression model is typically written as:

y = mx + b

Where:

y is the dependent variable you're trying to predict.
x is the independent variable.
m represents the slope of the line, indicating the strength and direction of the relationship.
b is the y-intercept, representing the value of y when x is zero.
Multiple linear regression extends this concept to multiple independent variables. It's widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, and machine learning, for tasks like forecasting, trend analysis, and understanding correlations between variables.
